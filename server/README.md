# Colour Game App

### What this project is about

This is a group project built during week 7 at Codaisseur academy.
In the game you will do a game based on the Stroop-task. You will see a word and have to say witch colour it is.

*	You play this game in a room so you can play against other people.

*	The game consists of different rounds. Each round you have to answer five questions. 

*	In the game you will see a word (the name of a colour). It will be printed in a different colour then the word says. Just name the colour of the word with the arrow keys.

*	At the end of the rounds you will see the score of the room. What is you ranking?
